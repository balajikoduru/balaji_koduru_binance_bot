# Report: Binance Futures Order Bot

**Date:** 2025-08-19

## Overview
This bot targets Binance **USDT-M Futures Testnet** and implements core order types (Market, Limit) plus **Stop-Limit** and a simple **TWAP** strategy. All API interactions use the official python-binance client with the base URL set to `https://testnet.binancefuture.com`.

## Screenshots / Evidence (suggested)
- Include screenshots of successful order placement from Binance Testnet UI and logs from `bot.log`.

## Design
- `FuturesClient`: centralizes Base URL, logging, retries, and convenience order methods.
- CLIs: Small, focused entrypoints that parse/validate arguments, then call the client.

## Logging
- Logs to `bot.log` with timestamps: requests, responses, warnings, and errors.

## Validation
- Basic validation on sides, positive numeric fields, and soft-check against symbol filters when available.

## Bonus
- **Stop-Limit**: Uses `FUTURE_ORDER_TYPE_STOP` with `stopPrice` and `price`.
- **TWAP**: Splits a large order into multiple slices, spaced by an interval.

## Future Work
- Add leverage & margin type controls.
- WebSocket to stream fills and PnL.
- Rich TIF and post-only support.
